# Intro

Here is a summary of advices I've given to people wanting to become a data scientist and new graduates.

First of all, make sure you have a real passion for data science and machine learning. Like in many things, the process is what lead ultimately to success. You need to be curious and excited to learn new things. This profession is highly rewarding. Things might now click immediately, but if you are persistent and will have good habits day in and day out, you will eventually succeed.

Three things I often recommend for people trying to enter the industry are:
- FastAI
- Kaggle
- Personal projects

# Take one great online course, then start competing in Kaggle

The best way to start, is to take an online class. fast.ai's "Deep Learning for Coders" course is a particularly good place to start, as there is a strong focus on the practical aspect.

After that, it's time to get your hands dirty and join Kaggle.

Don't focus on the Kaggle's Leaderboard. [A strong system will eventually lead you to success](https://fs.blog/2017/06/habits-vs-goals/). Try to make little progress every day. It's a long game and you are here to learn. 

# Practice over theory

One of the biggest mistake I've seen many people do is to spend a disproportionate amount of time studying the theory before starting to work on their first non-trivial project. This is the wrong way to go about it. The theory is certainly important, but practice is what solidify understanding and make you ultimately able to build things. This doesn't mean you shouldn't spend time learning the theory. Theory and practice should complement each other.

Your curiosity should drive you to learn things necessary to make you understand what you're doing. Knowledge without practice will quickly be forgotten. Learn as you need and make sure that every new concept sits on a mental map of the space.

# Make your project fantastic

I think [Jeremy Howard](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward)'s advice here is absolutely spot on.

> Pick one project. Do it really well. Make it fantastic.

Preferably, work on one project at the time, and make sure you're proud of your work.

Learn when is time to move on from a project, and focus on a new one.
