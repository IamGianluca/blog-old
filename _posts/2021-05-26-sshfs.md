title: The easiest way to browse images stored in a remote server

Today, I want to share how you can mount a remote drive locally. This is particularly useful when developing on a remote server. For instance, if we're working on a computer vision task, we might want to see how some of the training images look.

> SSHFS allows you to mount a remote filesystem using SFTP. Most SSH servers support and enable this SFTP access by default, so SSHFS is very simple to use - there's nothing to do on the server-side.

Let's first install [`sshfs`](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs). In Ubuntu, you can do it with the following command:

```
$ sudo apt install sshfs
```

We need to create an empty directory (a.k.a. mountpoint) to mount the remote drive. Let's call this folder `my_folder`:

```
$ mkdir ~/my_folder
```

Finally, let's mount the remote filesystem:

```
$ sshfs -o follow_symlinks <user>@<server address>:/ ~/my_folder
```

There you go! When you use your file explorer to open `my_folder,` you'll see the remote drive mounted.
