Hi :wave:

My name is Gianluca and I'm a Data Science Manager based in New York City.

My career in Data Science started in London (UK) in 2013, where I joined a start-up focusing on Real-Time Bidding (RTB) for digital advertising. Since then, many things have changed, and I've been fortunate to meet many incredible people who helped me shape who I am.

I'm passionate about ML/DL and how this technology is changing the world. On my spare time, I'm always working on side projects involving ML/DL or reading the latest research papers. 

My motivations to start blogging are:
1. Build a bigger platform to share my knowledge and advice.
2. To quote Richard Feynman, "*If you want to master something, teach it.*"
3. Connect with a wider network of likeminded people.

I hope you enjoy the content. If you have any feedback, reach out to me at my email address: "gr\<dot\>gianlucarossi\<at\>gmail\<dot\>com".
