Hi, my name is Gianluca, and I'm a data scientist based in New York. I'm passionate about building ML/AI systems and lifelong learning.

My career in Data Science started in London (UK) in 2013, where I joined a start-up focusing on RTB for online advertising. Since then, many things have changed, and I've been fortunate to meet many incredible people who helped me shape who I am.

This blog aims to share some of what I've learned along the way and hopefully connect with like-minded people. I hope you find the content useful to you. If you like it, feel free to share it with others. My ultimate goal is to make ML/DL more accessible.
