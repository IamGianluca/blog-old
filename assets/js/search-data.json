            "title": "Advise to an intermediate Deep Learning practitioner",
            "content": "Intro . This article targets practitioners with at least a couple of years of experience. You should be familiar with the basics of Machine Learning and have at least three (or more) projects under your belt. My goal is to share my advice on how you can increase your productivity as a Machine Learning and Deep Learning practitioner. . Generally speaking, three things can help you become more productive: . Have a rigorous process ― in other words, know what you’re doing | Iterate faster | Have an effective development environment | . We will see how these themes will come up repeatedly in this article. . Learn how to code . The best investment in your productivity is to learn how to code. This means writing code that is reusable and modular. Don’t Repeat Yourself and Keep It Simple (Stupid) . Refactor your code often. Don’t procrastinate when you notice things in your code that can be improved. Cruft accumulates rapidly and in no time will prevent you from iterate quickly. Refactoring is a critical component of the development lifecycle. Don’t neglect that. . There are three books I often recommend about good software development practices: . “Clean Code” by Robert Cecil Martin | “Refactoring” by Martin Fowler | “Architecture Patterns with Python” by Harry Percival and Bob Gregory | . Two key points here are consistency and discipline. You will get there! . Master your tools . As an ML practitioner, you will spend lots of your time working on a remote Linux server and working with code. There are some tools you must learn how to use well if you want to be effective. These include: . Git | Linux | Docker | . Some tools I often recommend are: . tmux | powerline-shell | dotfiles: There are plenty of dotfiles managers out there. Choose one that works for you and keep your dotfiles under version control. Ideally, you would like to install your dotfiles in a new machine with one command. | . In terms of ML Ops tools, I highly recommend: . dvc: Think about it as Git for Machine Learning | . I would also recommend you to choose some popular libraries and try to stick to them unless there is a clear advantage in switching to a new one. The software engineering and ML worlds are moving rapidly, and new tools are released daily. Your goal is to be effective at build things, not learning the last fancy tool. . IDE . Knowing your IDE is essential. You will spend lots of time in it. You better be familiar with how to get the best out of it. Learn keybindings and keyboard shortcuts for those operations you do regularly. Master how to rapidly navigate the codebase ― e.g., jump to definition, rename a symbol, etc. Research the plugins that make you more productive, but don’t go too crazy with plugins. The key here is the compound effect. The faster you navigate a project, the quicker you can implement new features and fix bugs. . Additionally, every time you notice a repeated pattern, search how you could automate this. A few minutes per day saved will accumulate and leave you more time to think/work on more valuable tasks. . Avoid religious wars about IDEs. Choose what’s best for you and stick to it. I would also recommend you to stay away from people that are too opinionated about IDEs. . Be comfortable with using a debugger . Bugs happen. Being able to interpret error messages and finding the root cause is critical to move fast. . Iterate fast . When starting a new project, you need to have a plan. . Define ML pipeline first . Start by building a skeleton for the ML pipeline. Implement all the necessary steps ― e.g., download -&gt; unzip -&gt; preprocess -&gt; train -&gt; predict -&gt; post-process ― without worrying too much about the overall solution. Simplify things as much as possible. Just make sure you have a pipeline you can rapidly improve on. . Cross-validation . Once you can the initial ML pipeline defined, it’s time to spend some serious time building a robust validation strategy. Remember, cross-validation is the most crucial thing in ML. If you don’t have confidence in your validation strategy, you can’t trust the results of your experiments. . Choose a good evaluation metric . This is another thing I’ve seen many get wrong. Think about what is your goal, and play with the metric. It would be a waste of time to spend months improving on a metric to discover that it doesn’t align with the business goals. . Sample data . Most of the time, there is no need to use all the available data. Make sure you’re working with enough data to have confidence in the results but little enough to be able to iterate quickly. The faster you iterate, the more ideas you can test, and the more progress you will make. Learning curves help identify a reasonable threshold for how much data you need. . Of course, use all data available when training your final model(s). But for rapid development purposes, if you can get the same answers in half the time, that’s huge. . Start with a simple baseline . Start easy. Don’t jump immediately to the latest fancy model/architecture. Begin with a linear model or even simple frequencies. Once you have established a baseline, try to improve on that. Do it gradually, though. . I’ve seen plenty of colleagues wasting months of work developing a fancy deep learning solution to discover that a simple linear model worked better. . Use your brain . Too often, I see young practitioners focusing on the wrong things at the wrong time. You must have a process and rigor. You don’t want to be right just because of luck. You want to be right 99% of the time because you know what you’re doing. . There are massive non-linearities in input and output between top practitioners and the rest of the field. Top practitioners know what to do and at what time. . Being “right” for the wrong reasons does not guarantee long-term success in this profession. You want to be “right” for the right reasons. Be honest with yourself. That will pay off in the long term. . One good resource for learning how to be an effective ML practitioner is “Machine Learning Yearning” by Andrew Ng. The book is still under development, but you can get free access to the most recent draft. . Be scientific . Formulate hypotheses and run experiments to validate them. If the experiment is not successful, make sure you understand why. That is how you build lasting knowledge. Don’t try random things in the hope of getting lucky. That is not effective. .",

            "content": "Today, I want to share how you can mount a remote drive locally. This is particularly useful when developing on a remote server. For instance, if we’re working on a computer vision task, we might want to see how some of the training images look. . SSHFS allows you to mount a remote filesystem using SFTP. Most SSH servers support and enable this SFTP access by default, so SSHFS is very simple to use - there’s nothing to do on the server-side. . Let’s first install sshfs. In Ubuntu, you can do it with the following command: . $ sudo apt install sshfs . We need to create an empty directory (a.k.a. mountpoint) to mount the remote drive. Let’s call this folder my_folder: . $ mkdir ~/my_folder . Finally, let’s mount the remote filesystem: . $ sshfs -o follow_symlinks &lt;user&gt;@&lt;server address&gt;:/ ~/my_folder . There you go! When you use your file explorer to open my_folder, you’ll see the remote drive mounted. .",
