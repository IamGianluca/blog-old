            "content": "Today, I want to share how you can mount a remote drive locally. This is particularly useful when developing on a remote server. For instance, if we’re working on a computer vision task, we might want to see how some of the training images look. . SSHFS allows you to mount a remote filesystem using SFTP. Most SSH servers support and enable this SFTP access by default, so SSHFS is very simple to use - there’s nothing to do on the server-side. . Let’s first install sshfs. In Ubuntu, you can do it with the following command: . $ sudo apt install sshfs . We need to create an empty directory (a.k.a. mountpoint) to mount the remote drive. Let’s call this folder my_folder: . $ mkdir ~/my_folder . Finally, let’s mount the remote filesystem: . $ sshfs -o follow_symlinks &lt;user&gt;@&lt;server address&gt;:/ ~/my_folder . There you go! When you use your file explorer to open my_folder, you’ll see the remote drive mounted. .",
